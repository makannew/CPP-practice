# C++ practice
In this repo I practice C++ programming through writing small basic programs. At this stage I focused on solutions by using simple variable names and avoid using constraints. So, be careful, programs might be crashed by entering out of range inputs.

here is the list of solutions and codes.

### [PI number](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/PI.cpp)
Using simplified [Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) (The BBP formula for π)to generate PI number. It gets number of decimal digits from user then displays pi and refrenced pi for comparison.
The limit of acuracy is about 16 decimal digits as a result of using a long double variable for pi number.

### [Prime Factoring](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/PrimeFactors.cpp)
It gets a number from user then displays all prime factors. At the end it checks if the number itself is a prime number or not. I tryed my best to find simplest solution without any unnecessary calculation to solve the problem.
