C++ practice
=========

In this repo I practice C++ programming through writing small basic programs. At this stage I focused on solutions by using simple structures. Therefore, the programs have not enough protective constraints and they might be crashed by entering out of range inputs.

## Here is the list of solutions and codes.
- [PI number](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/README.md#pi-number)
- [Prime Factoring](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/README.md#prime-factoring)
- [e number](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/README.md#e-number)
- [Bubble sorting](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/README.md#Bubble-sorting)

### [PI number](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/PI.cpp)
Using simplified [Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) (The BBP formula for π)to generate PI number. It gets number of decimal digits from user then displays pi and refrenced pi for comparison.
The limit of acuracy is about 16 decimal digits as a result of using a long double variable for pi number.

### [Prime Factoring](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/PrimeFactors.cpp)
It gets a number from user then displays all prime factors. At the end it checks if the number itself is a prime number or not. I tryed my best to find simplest solution without any unnecessary calculation to solve the problem.

### [e number](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/e%20number%20calculator.cpp)
[e (mathematical constant)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) as base of the natural logarithm can be calculated as the sum of the infinite series. It adds series calculations to satisfy 16 decimal digits precision of long double data type.

### [Bubble sorting](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice/blob/master/Bubble-Sort.cpp)
Practice of using [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm to sort array of numbers. It is not very efficient but it can detect already sorted list in first pass.
