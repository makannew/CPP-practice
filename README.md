# C++ practice
In this repo I practice C++ programming through writing small basic programs.

here is the list of them.

## PI number
using simplified [Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) (The BBP formula for π)to generate PI number. It gets desired number of decimal digit from user then display pi and refrenced pi for comparison.

The limit of acuracy is about 16 decimal digit as a result of using a long double variable for pi number. (HERE)[
        CPP-practice-/PI.cpp      ] is my code.
