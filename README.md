# C++ practice
In this repo I practice C++ programming through writing small basic programs.

here is the list of them.

### [PI number](https://github.com/makannew/CPP-practice-/blob/master/PI.cpp)
Using simplified [Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) (The BBP formula for π)to generate PI number. It gets number of decimal digits from user then displays pi and refrenced pi for comparison.
The limit of acuracy is about 16 decimal digits as a result of using a long double variable for pi number.
